# Competitive-Programming
Algorithms and data structures useful for Competitive Programming

The learning path for this repo was taken from Junior Training Sheet from Dr Mostafa Saad (see  https://codeforces.com/blog/mostafa.saad.fci)

What have I learnt? 

Section A

Big O notation
Practice hard to implement problems
Java Big Intenger for special scenarios
How to handle dates with custom library
Graphs - DFS
Graphs - Topological sort
Combinatronics - Combinations, permutatios, factorial, principle of inclusion and exclusion.
Handle points and vectors
Basic bitmask
Next permutation in C++ 
String and its methods
Convert decimal intenger to binary string
Binary search

Section B

Number theory - Fibonachi numbers, GCD, LCM
Modular arithmatics - Modular operations, binary exponentiation
Stack, queue and dequeue
Prefix sum 1D and 2D
Graphs - BFS in graph and grid
Recursion
See next two contest, good to practice backtracking
